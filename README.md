# Frontend Mentor - News homepage solution

This is my solution to the **News homepage challenge** on Frontend Mentor. This project helped me strengthen my responsive design skills using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for interactive elements
* Open and close the mobile navigation menu

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS Grid
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow
* JavaScript (for mobile menu toggle)

---

### What I learned

This project helped me:

* Practice building responsive layouts using CSS Grid
* Combine Grid and Flexbox effectively
* Implement a mobile navigation drawer using JavaScript
* Improve my understanding of class toggling with `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()`

Example of the JavaScript used for the mobile menu:

```js
menuIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
  mobileNav.classList.add('active');
  overlay.classList.add('active');
});
```

I also learned how important media queries are when creating mobile-first designs.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve my JavaScript skills
* Practice cleaner, more scalable CSS structure
* Explore accessibility improvements (focus states, ARIA labels)
* Work on smoother animations and transitions

---

### Useful resources

* MDN Web Docs – For understanding CSS Grid and JavaScript event listeners
* Frontend Mentor Community – For seeing how others approached the layout

---

### AI Collaboration

I used ChatGPT to:

* Debug layout issues
* Understand how to implement the mobile navigation toggle
* Improve and structure this README

AI helped speed up debugging and clarify confusing areas, but I made sure to understand the logic before implementing the solutions.
